Movie-Match
Movie-Match is a social media web application where users can like movies and find matches with other users. It is built using the MERN stack with MongoDB hosting the database, a Node.js/Express.js API serving the content and hosted on Heroku, and a React.js frontend hosted on Netlify. Redux was used for state management. CSS stying was carried out using React Bootstrap.
